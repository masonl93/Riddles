    "This is an interesting probability question! Let's approach it step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First, let's clarify what we're dealing with:\n",
    "   - We're sampling from an exponential distribution with mean 1 (which means its rate parameter λ = 1)\n",
    "   - We're adding these samples together\n",
    "   - We want to know how many samples, on average, it takes for this sum to exceed 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This problem is actually a well-known one in probability theory. It's related to what's called the \"renewal process\" with exponential inter-arrival times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The key insight is that this problem is equivalent to asking: \"What's the expected number of events in a Poisson process before time 1?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Why? Because the sum of exponential random variables with rate λ up to a fixed value is equivalent to counting the number of events in a Poisson process up to that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) For a Poisson process with rate λ = 1, the expected number of events by time t is simply t.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Therefore, the expected number of events by time 1 is just 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the answer is that the expected number of samples before the running total first exceeds 1 is e (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828).\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem counterintuitive at first, but remember:\n",
    "- Some sequences will exceed 1 very quickly (like if the first sample is > 1)\n",
    "- Others might take many small samples to exceed 1\n",
    "- On average, it will take e samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?"
